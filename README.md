## Challenges
This was my first time collaborating on an app with other people.  A lot of the challenges came from understanding our roles and managing code with GIT.  In terms of code our biggest challenge was how to make it so a user could either rent a toilet or provide a toilet for others to rent.

## Solution
Communication.  From the time we started each day we had defined which part of the app we would be focusing on.  We used to trello to help manage what we were working on and what was still left to do.

To separate a user's intensions we created a namespace that was nested for users who were providing toilets for others to rent.

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed making this app.  It was an enjoyable time with the team and I learned a lot about the communication challenges that go into making a large app.  I also really enjoyed at the toilet bowl marker to the map when users searched for toilets.
